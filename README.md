# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The project was to examine PyBer ride-sahring data and break the analysis down by city type.  A Pandas DataFrame was created and then graphs utilizing Matplotlib functionality were employed to provide displays of the differences of the ride sharing data by city type and week fares.  Insights into these trends are then used to provide guidance for decisions by PyBer leadership.
